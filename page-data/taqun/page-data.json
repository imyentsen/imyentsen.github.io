In the first half of this year, I have experienced my first and failed startup experience, in my age of 27, which is seemingly not too old. I’d love to jot down something before the memories have been fading beyond my scope.</p>\n<p>I have been dreaming to create a product for the hard-of-hearing community to enjoy music for a long time. As a hearing aid user with profound hearing loss, listening to music is an essential part of my life yet not that easy for me to enjoy on-the-go. The problem is dead simple: none of the existing earbuds or earphones works with hearing aids. Since hearing aids already sit within ears, fitting another device into the ears isn’t possible.</p>\n<hr>\n<img style=\"height: 310px;\" src=\"./interview.jpg\" alt=\"I was interviewing with Maija about her experience wearing cochlear implant. She later became a member of our team.\">\n<figcaption>I was interviewing with Maija about her experience wearing cochlear implant. She later became a member of our team.</figcaption>\n<hr>\n<p>Hai is a startup project, and also my attempt to offer a solution. I was dreaming to create a product that is beautifully accessible, especially for those who are single-sided aid users or users of two different brands of hearing aids. They are the minorities of the minority. Even the hearing aid producers would ignore their need because of the limited market size. However, the long-tail effect in e-commerce may make the market an economically sustainable one.</p>\n<p>The lack of aesthetics in the assistive products is another elephant in the room. Many people are indifferent about the ugly and slam looks of the products - until they need to use them. Stigma is attached to the users of the products along with their medicalized looks. As a designer, I truly want to make a change by getting my hands dirty.</p>\n<hr>\n<img style=\"height: 310px;\" src=\"./mockup.jpg\" alt=\"Hai's mockup\">\n<figcaption>Hai's mockup. The users can pimp and personalize their Hai with stickers. Personalization has been an effective way for the assistive product users to express self and diminish the stigma associated with the use of products.</figcaption>\n<hr>\n<p>The ugly hearing assistive products and the design of HaiI was talking about the problem to my friends and started to plan to build up a team. I know little about electronic engineering, and I was very lucky to have Kevin join the team. He is a long-time friend of mine, who was an engineer with experience in developing drones and robot hands. Since early 2019, we embarked on background research about the potential users, the competitive products, the technical feasibility, and potential funding.</p>\n<p>In early 2020, I graduated from Aalto University, Finland and obtain a MA degree in Design. When I was working for my master’s thesis I can only spend part of my time on Hai. After my thesis has been done, I felt like devoting all of myself in this project and make it come true.</p>\n<p>We have been working very hard on developing the mockups. Fortunately, we got a grant from the government of Taiwan to financially support part of the cost. However, we still need way more than the grant to move on to mass production. I thought it was about the time to kick off a campaign of Hai and seek further funding.</p>\n<p>I moved back to Taiwan and started to work for this project full-time. We built up a team with three new members, Kalle and Maija from Finland, and Olaide from Ireland. They were responsible for community building and marketing. Kevin was the project manager and the major engineer in coordination with several other contract audio engineers. I was solely working as a designer responsible for the industrial design of Hai, design researcher and strategist for the brand/customer/user experience of the company. I was also a graphic designer, who produced all the visual marketing material.</p>\n<hr>\n<img style=\"height: 310px;\" src=\"./brand.jpg\" alt=\"Branding of Rearia Hai\">\n<figcaption>A glance at the branding system of Rearia and Hai, which conveys the corporate and product identity to the public. It is also a platform which shows the characteristics of \"Innovative, Friendly, Confident, Dynamic, and Tech savvy,\" in contrary to the current mainstream assistive products.</figcaption>\n<hr>\n<p>In a close-knit startup team, heterogeneous involvement always happens naturally across different disciplines. I contributed all I have known and learnt from my previous working experience to the Hai project. As such, I also served as a front-end developer who crafted our website; I managed to become a copywriter, who wrote a considerable part of the content on our social media, newsletters, and the Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign. I also played the role of a lay HR, who recruited several part-time talents and freelancers for some urgent needs. Kevin and I also had to establish an internal workflow and information system to manage everything. As the founders, finance and accounting are also disturbing yet essential tasks to deal with.</p>\n<hr>\n<figure class=\"grid-image\"><div class=\"grid-image-grid\" style=\"\n            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(48%, 1fr));\n          \">\n<img src=\"./photograph.jpg\" width=\"100%;\">\n<img src=\"./website.jpg\" width=\"100%;\">\n</div></figure>\n<figcaption>Part of the photographs for Hai's marketing that I took; an overview of the visual design material, including logos, photos, website, newsletters</figcaption>\n<hr>\n<p>Long story short, at the end of the campaign in August, we raised €4,453 EUR from 22 backers. Our goal was set at €10,000EUR. We failed hard to reach such a low threshold. Therefore, we won’t be able to use the important numbers and data, such as the CPC, CPM, and so on, to lure the potential angel investors for the further fund to carry on.</p>\n<p>In the very beginning days of the campaign, we have learnt that the progress was not going very well - we have collected a considerable number (~2,200, which exceeded the number that our contract marketing specialist suggested) of email followers beforehand, but few of them backed us.</p>\n<p>The Facebook Group of HaiWe talked with our communities (we built up a Facebook group of around 300 hard-of-hearing people who are interested in our product from our Facebook page/Instagram/newsletter subscribers) and regretfully realized that supporting a crowdfunding product on the price range (~200 USD) sounds risky for the hard-of-hearing people.</p>\n<hr>\n<img style=\"height: 310px;\" src=\"./communities.jpg\" alt=\"communities\">\n<figcaption>The Facebook Group of Hai and part of the newsletters</figcaption>\n<hr>\n<p>As the hearing conditions vary, we should have been able to provide more sufficient information and make the product more credible. For example, if we can complete the demo on time as planned, without the intervention by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused the closure of our upstream suppliers in China and disrupted our logistics, we could have sent out our demos to the third-party influencers for unboxing reviews. That could have made the Hai device more convincing and trustworthy as a crowdfunding product. Also, it would be great if we can provide several demo devices so that people could try it out in person - which was difficult for a tiny startup with a limited runway in this pandemic time.</p>\n<p>The spread of COVID-19 has had a very negative impact on our target market. Many people are suffering from financial difficulties. Some of them are more economically vulnerable than the others. We have also heard that a few companies have also postponed their product launches. Hai, apparently, has become less affordable, although we have made our best to lower its price. The price is still not appealing enough to trigger the curiosity to try it out on a crowdfunding campaign.</p>\n<p>These few months have been truly an adventure in my life. The fail of the campaign does not mean an end of Hai to me. It’s like one of the dots in my life, in Steve Jobs’ words, to be connected in the future.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was talking with several coaches from the accelerators in Finland and Taiwan, who have experience in crowdfunding campaign. One of the most useful advice was from Mike Bradshaw, who also ran a failed campaign and used his experience to coach and encourage people. He talked about the stress during and after the campaign, and he also stressed that it takes time to recover.</p>\n<hr>\n<img style=\"height: 310px;\" src=\"./indiegogo.jpg\" alt=\"indiegogo\">\n<figcaption>The Indiegogo page of our crowdfunding campaign</figcaption>\n<hr>\n<p>The startup project and the preparation of campaign ruin my sense of routine. I also suffered from acute insomnia periodically. I found that I could not stop my brain from working at a proper time. There were always tasks unfinished before sleep. When you are deeply engaged in a project, fighting against perfectionism could be hard.</p>\n<p>After the fail, I could eventually take a rest, reflect on my life pace, and think about how to reframe a new normal.\nPeople are talking about what it would be like if there must be a new normal after the pandemic. It feels that I’m recovering and making changes in life along with way more people around as well as the wider societies. To me, the new normal means spending some real quality time to enjoy the life in my home country, Taiwan, with my friends and families. It also means a reflection process - to keep my portfolio up-to-date, to polish the details, and think about what the next place to contribute my knowledge and skills is.</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Taqun","path":"/taqun/","category":["Frontend","Branding","UI"],"skill":null,"role":["UI (Figma)","Branding","Front-end Devlopment (HTML, CSS, React)"],"description":"Brand identity guidelines of Taqun Ltd., Taiwan and its intro webpage for an easy-access to the media and other stakeholders","date":"2019","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":500,"height":346,"src":"/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/0f3a1/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/0f3a1/cover.jpg 1x,\n/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/f9913/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/a7715/cover.jpg 2x","srcWebp":"/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/e9589/cover.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/e9589/cover.webp 1x,\n/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/e557c/cover.webp 1.5x,\n/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/e30b5/cover.webp 2x"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4492753623188406,"src":"/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/a1eb1/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/4fa6c/cover.jpg 200w,\n/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/64b17/cover.jpg 400w,\n/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/a1eb1/cover.jpg 800w,\n/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/a6c62/cover.jpg 1200w,\n/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/70ff9/cover.jpg 1600w,\n/static/9cfb462a1e6fbb7e9c256bf51f33f2cb/b4fbb/cover.jpg 2500w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
