# Objectives

To create a distinctive and inclusive brand identity for the assistive headphone product, combating stigma and reinforcing its mission of empowering hard-of-hearing users. The branding needed to evoke warmth, innovation, and accessibility while differentiating the product from traditional medical devices.

# My Role

As the lead designer, I was responsible for:

- Crafting the visual identity, including colour palette, typography, and logo design.
- Developing marketing materials that align with the product’s inclusive and empowering vision.
- Ensuring the branding reflected user feedback and cultural insights.
- Collaborating with the 2 other team members in marketing to maintain consistency across all touchpoints.

# Challenge

Assistive devices often have a clinical and utilitarian appearance, which reinforces stigma and discourages their use. The challenge was to design branding that appeals to users’ emotions, communicates warmth, and challenges stereotypes, while maintaining functionality and clarity.
