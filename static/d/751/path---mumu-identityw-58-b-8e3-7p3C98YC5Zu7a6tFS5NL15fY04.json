User interface and experience have an unevenly important impact on this ongoing crisis. The digital democratic communication is truly one of the most prominent types of practice which has a great diversity within, whereas filter bubble has also become a trendy word describing the ubiquitous silos created by groups of like-minded people online. </p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>The research will be an attempt to explore the potential of user interface and human centered design for sustaining a consolidated democratic future. Taking the feasible scale of a masterâ€™s thesis into account, the exploration is narrowed down to a core question: <strong>How to design interactive argument diagram for democratic communication?</strong></p>\n\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem;; max-width: 2000px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 35.34777651083238%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Two examples of interactive argument diagram:  Kialo (left) and Pol.is (right)\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/figure-2b4ca21a3df593164e169642ac0a2d2e-7874f.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/figure-2b4ca21a3df593164e169642ac0a2d2e-cf602.jpg 500w,\n/static/figure-2b4ca21a3df593164e169642ac0a2d2e-ec5b1.jpg 1000w,\n/static/figure-2b4ca21a3df593164e169642ac0a2d2e-7874f.jpg 2000w,\n/static/figure-2b4ca21a3df593164e169642ac0a2d2e-b35a9.jpg 3000w,\n/static/figure-2b4ca21a3df593164e169642ac0a2d2e-948c0.jpg 3508w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n<figcaption>Two examples of interactive argument diagram:  Kialo (left) and Pol.is (right)</figcaption>\n<p>The overall methodology is a mixture of research through and for design.
