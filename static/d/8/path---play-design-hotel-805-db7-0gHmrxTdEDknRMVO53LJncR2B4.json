It is also one of the world’s first guest customizable hotel where guests are invited to select different design furniture and artefacts using an online reservation system. </p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Introducing the old and the new landscapes in taipei</h2>\n<p>Play Design Hotel is situated in a unique area, which is categorised as the west district of Taipei. Unlike the growing east district of Taipei, the development of the west counterpart is significantly slower. The west district of Taipei has a comfortable living pace and comprises several smaller districts, which have various different styles that enrich the experience of the visitors.</p>\n<p>East of Play Design Hotel is the youthful district – the fashionable Zhongshan Business District(中山商圈). The designer stores, coffee shops, and clothing stores are testaments of Taipei’s taste, attitude, and interpretation of life.</p>\n<p>West of the Play Design Hotel is the nostalgic Taipei – Dadaocheng(大稻埕), full of the glamor of old Taipei. Closely situated grocery stores, herb stores, snack shops, and tea houses facilitates the conversation between brand building and community experiences, forming an old-town atmosphere.</p>\n<p>We conducted a two-month fieldwork around Dadaocheng and Zhongshan Business District to collect tourist information and investigate the historical context. The outcome of the research process is the solid foundation for not only the development of the interior style of the hotel, but also the editorial work of the travel guide and introductory handbook. </p>\n<h2>A platform of tangible memory and experience</h2>\n<p>Play design hotel is a platform of tangible memory and experience. The unique taiwanese designs and local stories come here and are fused seamless. We decided to make the concept of “Platform” penetrate through every single detail of the aesthetic experience.</p>\n<p>The walls is one of the demonstration of our concept “platform”. The perfectly smooth concrete walls are the hotel’s skins wrapped in stretch fabric. The sturdy foundation for styles and characters is absolutely clean and pure. It carries the design and interact with it as humans do with their skins, feeling the aesthetics and culture within the design.</p>\n<p>The concept of “platform” is also behind the every creation of the travel guide, introductory book, and other branding applications. The transparent and empty elements are both the reifications of abstract concept, which allow the surrounding materials and visual elements to be included into the design. </p>\n<h2>Travel guide and introductory handbook</h2>\n<p>With the solid foundation of local observation, I was responsible for the editorial work and design of the travel guide and introductory handbook.</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Introductory Journey of Play Design Hotel","path":"/play-design-hotel/","category":"work","tags":["Service Design","User Interface","Graphic Design"],"description":"Play Design Hotel received an Honorable Mention in the User Experience category in Fast Company’s 2016 Innovation by Design Awards.
