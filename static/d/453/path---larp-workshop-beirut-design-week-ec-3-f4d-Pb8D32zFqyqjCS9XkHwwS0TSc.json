They perform their embodied knowledge and actively reshape the world they create. The participants embody the imagination of their own and identify the relationship created during the process. Several questions were kept asking: How are these relationships possible? Are those relationships desirable? In our workshop, we aimed to explore the great potential hasn’t been clearly identified yet.</p>\n<p>(un)Real Economies is the core theme explored in our workshop, which aims to facilitate the sensibility of diverse economies among the participants.</p>\n<p>30–50 % of all economic activity in the world constitute non-capitalist economic activities (Gibson-Graham, 2008). Yet in the neoliberalist machine, we are living in today, monetized economies are by far the ones dominating not only the discourse but our sense of reality. By facilitating a LARP, we want to shift our sight to see the unseen, to the non-market transactions, unpaid household work, alternative currencies, co-op exchange, hunting and gathering. What are the diverse economies that exist today and what could they be in the future? </p>\n\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem;; max-width: 715px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 88.81118881118881%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"The Iceberg of diverse economies.

We provided several pre-reading materials for our participants, which are the introduction of LARP and improvisation theatre and the introduction of the concept of diverse economies by Katherine Gibson.</p>\n<p>During the workshop, all sessions were organised in the following order: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>introduction to the concept of diverse economies</li>\n<li>outline of the sessions of the workshop</li>\n<li>several improv exercises</li>\n<li>LARP design</li>\n<li>LARP and debrief session</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We briefly introduced the concept of diverse economies, and then, while doing the improv exercises. The aim of the exercises is to encourage the participants to warm up prior to the stretching and more strenuous LARP. We would like to enable them to act out the alternative personalities different from their usual. Therefore, some of the small exercises look silly, but they worked in a natural and effective way.</p>\n<video width=\"100%\" controls autoplay>\n  <source src=\"/gift-giving-bf3cc09ca405e08d378997b74bd7fac8.mov\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n<figcaption>a birthday gift-giving exercise</figcaption>\n<p>After several times of ideation and exercises, we made all the participants were working together to design an service that is an alternative to the current economies. The service that we ended up using for the larp was ‘Stoned’ a company dedicated to make people feel uncomfortable through the act of staring into your friend’s eyes. </p>\n\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem;; max-width: 1800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"The Iceberg of diverse economies.

Or, by seeing new connections and how they develop, when you just play along with the story. In the larp ‘the enemy’ of ‘Stoned’ together with her wife, came up with that she should target the ‘tired parent’ to steal customers away from the company. The room we facilitated the workshop was filled with their delightful hum of conversation and laugh.</p>\n<video width=\"100%\" controls autoplay muted>\n  <source src=\"/larp-ddd43d8530c69c5066fd5eec728d4fd2.mov\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n<p>Many of them said that the workshop was very interesting and fun. For all of them, it was the first experience of LARPing. One thing interesting was that the difference their originally normal characters could be seen. Although it sounded weird to provide a service that aims to make the customer feel uncomfortable, it was still effective to expand the imagination of value and investigate the new values.</p>\n<h2>Reflection</h2>\n<p>Although improvisation has been widely used in designing for services, especially for the purpose of empathizing and sparking creativity, it seems to us that it can be pushed forward to seeing how to apply in speculative and empowering purposes. We would love to establish a more solid understanding for it on the development in design as well as the outcome of this method by conducting more case studies and LARP practices.</p>\n<h2>Link</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://un-real.fun\" target=\"blank\">The official webpage for the workshop</a> (In English)</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Performing (un)Real Economies","path":"/larp-workshop-beirut-design-week/","category":"work","tags":["Participatory design","Democracy design","Infrastructuring","LARP"],"description":"The workshop was a part of the official program of Beirut Design Week, 2018.
