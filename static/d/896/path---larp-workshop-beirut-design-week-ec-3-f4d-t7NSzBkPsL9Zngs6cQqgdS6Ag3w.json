What about the knowledge at a deeper level that is neither expressible in explicit language nor in behaviour? What about the knowledge that we already have that we have not yet harnessed? </p>\n<p>So why don’t let the participants ride by themselves? So why don’t let those affected by a design? They have the power to change themselves. Their life experience, their embodied knowledge, and their interpretation don’t necessarily be the objects that require the designers to observe and to study. They can be turned into the active subjects, the observers as well as the makers themselves.</p>\n<p>What if we shift our focus - to make use of LARP as an facilitation or an action of activism? What if the concept of critical and speculative design being involved in participatory design with LARP? The participants, through role-play, can escape from the original constraints given by their social roles while still holding a reflective perspective toward their own performance. They actively reshape the world they create. The participants embody the imagination of their own and identify the relationship created during the process. Several questions were kept asking: How are these relationships possible? Are those relationships desirable? In our workshop, we aimed to explore the great potential hasn’t been clearly identified yet.</p>\n<h2>Theme: (un)Real Economies</h2>\n<p>(un)Real Economies is the core theme explored in our workshop, which aims to facilitate the sensibility of diverse economies among the participants.</p>\n\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem;; max-width: 715px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 88.81118881118881%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"The Iceberg of diverse economies.

Drawing by J.K. Gibson-Graham</em></p>\n<p>The Iceberg of diverse economies. Drawing by J.K. Gibson-Graham30–50 % of all economic activity in the world constitute non-capitalist economic activities (Gibson-Graham, 2008). Yet in the neoliberalist machine, we are living in today, monetized economies are by far the ones dominating not only the discourse but our sense of reality. We want to shift our sight to see the unseen (see the figure above), to the non-market transactions, unpaid household work, alternative currencies, co-op exchange, hunting and gathering. What are the diverse economies that exist today and what could they be in the future? What is the definition of value, and how is it (and how could it be) determined, felt, understood, recorded and transferred? How do different definitions of labour and productivity change our notions of the concept ‘economy’? The workshop will have play and fun as a central objective, can play be productive?</p>\n<h2>The facilitation of the workshop</h2>\n<p>The workshop lasted a full day from 10 to 17. We provided several pre-reading materials for our participants, which are the introduction of LARP and improvisation theatre and the introduction of the concept of diverse economies by Katherine Gibson.</p>\n<p>During the workshop, all sessions were organised in the following order: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>introduction to the concept of diverse economies</li>\n<li>outline of the sessions of the workshop</li>\n<li>several improv exercises</li>\n<li>LARP design</li>\n<li>LARP and debrief session</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We briefly introduced the concept of diverse economies, and then, while doing the improv exercises. The aim of the exercises is to encourage the participants to warm up prior to the stretching and more strenuous LARP. We would like to enable them to act out the alternative personalities different from their usual. Therefore, some of the small exercises look silly, but they worked in a natural and effective way.</p>\n<video width=\"100%\" controls autoplay>\n  <source src=\"/gift-giving-bf3cc09ca405e08d378997b74bd7fac8.mov\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n<p><em>a birthday gift-giving exercise</em></p>\n<p>After several times of ideation and exercises, we made all the participants were working together to design an service that is an alternative to the current economies. The service that we ended up using for the larp was ‘Stoned’ a company dedicated to make people feel uncomfortable through the act of staring into your friend’s eyes. </p>\n<p>Either taking the role as a client/customer (a specific one!) in order to take a look at the service through their eyes while not focusing on design details. Or, by seeing new connections and how they develop, when you just play along with the story. In the larp ‘the enemy’ of ‘Stoned’ together with her wife, came up with that she should target the ‘tired parent’ to steal customers away from the company. The room we facilitated the workshop was filled with their delightful hum of conversation and laugh.</p>\n<p>Many of them said that the workshop was very interesting and fun. For all of them, it was the first experience of LARPing. One thing interesting was that the difference their originally normal characters could be seen. Although it sounded weird to provide a service that aims to make the customer feel uncomfortable, it was still effective to expand the imagination of value and investigate the new values.</p>\n<h2>Future I</h2>\n<p>We haven’t positioned LARP and improvisation in the context of design clearly. That is, to establish a solid foundation for it on the development in design, and thus we could point out the direction for future development. </p>\n<p>Although improvisation has been widely used in designing for services, especially for the purpose of empathizing and sparking creativity, it can be pushed forward to seeing how to apply in speculative and empowering purposes.</p>\n<p>In addition, the schedule was a bit to tight, therefore, although the participants thought that the workshop was interesting in general, there was still a lack of a reasonable linkage between the method and the theme, diverse economies. We didn’t want to make the workshop to serious and thus stressful to the participants, but there is still room for improvement for combining the fun, playfulness with a serious theme.</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Performing (un)Real Economies","path":"/larp-workshop-beirut-design-week/","category":"work","tags":["Participatory design","Democracy design","Infrastructuring","LARP"],"description":"The workshop was a part of the official program of Beirut Design Week, 2018.
