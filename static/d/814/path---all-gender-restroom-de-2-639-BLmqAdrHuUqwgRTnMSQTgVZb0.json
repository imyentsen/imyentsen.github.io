It describes the system in which a society splits its members into one of two sets of gender roles, gender identities and attributes based on reproductive organs. It forms the basis for how you are educated, what jobs you can do (or are expected to do), how you are expected to behave, what you are expected to wear, what your gender and gender presentation should be, and who you should be attracted/ to love/ to marry, etc.</p>\n<p>This system probably forms an oppression and discrimination on everyone of us if we are perceived to be outside the binary. Many of us are constantly putting ourselves and others in gender boxes that we just don’t fit into, whether or not we identify as transgender. </p>\n<p>For example, the following picture is a screenshot taken from the search result of “toilet sign” on thenounproject.com. Most of the signs reveal how culture wants your gender to look. Should we take this binary for granted? Imagine that you are a man not physically stronger than women. Imagine that you are a female student fighting for your right to wear pants to school. This is not to negate the specific discrimination that trans-identified people experience daily and systemically, but gender oppression affects everyone.</p>\n<p>I hope that my design would contribute to establish more and more friendly spaces. By truly embracing transgender equality, I believe we can all begin to define what it means to be a man or a woman on our own terms and liberate ourselves from the gender oppression we impose on ourselves and each other.</p>\n<h2>Project background</h2>\n<p>In Taiwan, still the ignorance, stereotype and even discrimination exist against the secual minorities among the mass. For instance, there is a lack of all-gender restroom in university campuses as well as public spaces.</p>\n<p>In 2016, I was invited to develop the first visual identity system for all-gender restroom in Taiwan by the Campus Planning Office of National Taiwan University(NTU). Our All-gender Restroom Plan aims to offer safe and friendly spaces for toilet-using regardless the sexualities and gender identities of the users. </p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Installation Guide for All-Gender Restroom","path":"/all-gender-restroom/","category":"work","tags":["Participatory design","User experience","Graphic design","Wayfinding system","Gender design"],"description":"The ignorance, stereotype and discrimination do exist against the sexual minorities among the mass.
