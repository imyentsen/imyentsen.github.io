As a newcomer with some experience in quantitative research, the official statistics was an important source for me to understand the country. I was impressed that the official statistics in Finland has a good quality of completeness and accessibility in English. While using the Statfin database, I gradually found some touch points which can be improved. </p>\n<p>Thatâ€™s why I chose to redesign it when we were asked to hand up a theme for our Information Design coursework at Aalto University. The redesign is an initial attempt and a prototype. More feedback and test is needed to concretize all the ideas.</p>\n<p>The core aim of the design is to lower the threshold for transforming cold statistics data into comprehensive information, which should be interactive and visualised. It could be helpful not only for the citizens but also for the government employees who need to make data-based reports. This transformation could be also a basis for more strengthened civil society.</p>\n<p>In order to submit it to the open call of showcase session of Visualize Knowledge 2018 conference, I spent more time after the course in bettering the detail of its design. The total period for conducting this project was around 6 weeks.</p>\n<img style=\"\" src=\"/img-1-c64ce6302f15d3e0399ea27340737810.gif\" alt=\"The concept of platform hosting the livable experience of Taiwanese design.\">\n<p><em>A glance at the interface after (left) and before (right) the redesign</em></p>\n<h3>Showcase</h3>\n\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem;; max-width: 1440px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 57.91666666666667%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAMABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMCBAX/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAQL/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAVmoh5RJGz//xAAZEAADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDIRH/2gAIAQEAAQUCWdjikSmeGnHXX//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREv/aAAgBAwEBPwGNP//EABcRAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhH/2gAIAQIBAT8BizH/xAAcEAABAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABCRAiExMqH/2gAIAQEABj8CyZV6jK26wb//xAAaEAADAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhQVFx/9oACAEBAAE/IRl/gMD0I6GvSXI2sS8P/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABAL7//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERAP/aAAgBAwEBPxBkuYZv/8QAGBEBAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITH/2gAIAQIBAT8QVeRlu//EABsQAQADAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExUXHR/9oACAEBAAE/EEqIeOCARGr5QQLb3+ze6XLwFg08lkkZwn//2Q==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"The concept of platform hosting the livable experience of Taiwanese design.\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/img-2-267b11628456bc96b6184171cd4d5208-daa98.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/img-2-267b11628456bc96b6184171cd4d5208-09631.jpg 500w,\n/static/img-2-267b11628456bc96b6184171cd4d5208-d85d3.jpg 1000w,\n/static/img-2-267b11628456bc96b6184171cd4d5208-daa98.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n<p>You can visit the webpage designed for the showcase session  <a href=\"https://yentsenliu.com/redesign_statfin/\" target=\"blank\">here</a>.
